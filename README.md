# MATLAB CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks code. 
This repository has some work on the Convolutional Neural Networks approach to image segmentation.

Some of this code is inspired by the Stanford's Deep Learning Tutorial (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/), as well as the Coursera's course on Machine Learning, so thanks for that.
